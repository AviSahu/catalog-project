There are 3 python files, HTML files (inside template folder) and other supporting files inside Static folder (css file)

# database_setup.py file helps in creating Table stucture and Data.py is supporting file for uploading initial data.

# Assignment can be run using project.py file (python project.py) in terminal. After running project file go to browser and input "localhost:5000". This will take you to front web page.

# Login icon will take you to login page. You can only login using Facebook and Google account. I have place Email and Password form for now but this wont work. Since, this will be quite addition effort for saving encrypted password into data, I have left this.

# Other functionality is same discribed in requirements for this assignment. There is Add item button if login. Edit and Delete authorization to only creater. Reading data from databases and updating.

# only feature which is not avalable is adding new category. This is not allowed since anyone can input arbitrary Category if this feature is given. 

# one can edit in categories provided. If new categories is required, it should be added once in any account from backend.

#I have commented created_date field in MenuItem table which is auto-created when entry is made. If required, this can be done.
